Editors notes :-)

Found this cute game project done during Highschool from my old
archives. It still seems to compile and is even playable so I decided
to publish it again.

Rest of this document is the original README.

Version 0.2.0


Introduction
------------

When I got my first computer (Amiga 500+), I got also few game floppies with
it. There was game called greed in one of those floppies. Because I didn't
find similar game for Linux, I made this.


Install
-------

Unpack the tar archive

  $ tar zxvf greedy-0.2.0.tar.gz

Run make and make install

  $ make

  $ make install

And then play greedy!

  $ greedy


Playing
-------

In greedy you must increase your score by collecting numbers by moving over
them. You can move using numpad. (Check that NumLock is on). Highlighted
numbers show how far you go when you move into that direction. The distance
is same than number value in square next to player (Little @ character).
If there are nothing but empty squares around player, game is over.
